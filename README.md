# Point Cloud Dynamics

This repository provides the Python code and Jupyter notebooks used to reproduce the numerical experiments reported in the article _Beyond Distance: Quantifying Point Cloud Dynamics with Persistent Homology and Dynamic Optimal Transport_.

This repository is heavily based on [tpot](https://github.com/zsteve/tpot). We thank the authors for open-sourcing their code.

Code in this repository also depends on the related repository [partitioned_networks](https://github.com/zsteve/partitioned_networks) and [topf](https://github.com/vincent-grande/topf), 
which is included as Git submodules in `tools/partitioned_networks` and `tools/topf`. To pull this after cloning this repo, run `git submodule update --init`.
